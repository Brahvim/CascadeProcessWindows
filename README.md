# CascadeProcessWindows
Perhaps my first *actual* experience with the WINAPI, and I tried to do this interesting project!

You start this program up, and (theoretically, all) the `Alt` + `Tab` menu window starts to move in circles.
The code is somehow ***PUT TOGETHER*** because I have a very weak understanding of OS handles...

I still love how it takes only 2 MB memory and is efficient enough!

### 30 December 2022:
The code needs an update, by the way. I should be checking for window handles in the loop - yes, it takes a lot of allocation and de-allocation, and could be slow, but that's alright. Also, I could store the window handles in a better manner. The code could also take a re-structure!
These changes were needed for a long time. I just didn't speak of it here. Will get this sorted someday!
