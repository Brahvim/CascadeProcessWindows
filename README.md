# CascadeProcessWindows
Perhaps my first *actual* experience with the WINAPI, and I tried to do this interesting project!

You start this program up, and (theoretically, all) the `Alt` + `Tab` menu window starts to move in circles.
The code is somehow ***PUT TOGETHER*** because I have a very weak understanding of OS handles...

I still love how it takes only 2 MB memory and is efficient enough!
